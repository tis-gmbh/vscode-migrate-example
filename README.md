# VSCode Migrate Example Project

This repository contains a small sample project for the [VSCode Migrate](https://github.com/tis-gmbh/vscode-migrate) extension for VSCode.

## Features

This project contains two simple files with four matches in total. Some of the matches a covered by Unit Tests written with Jest, some are not.

## Usage

Install [VSCode Migrate](https://github.com/tis-gmbh/vscode-migrate), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), clone this repo and run `npm i`. Use the extension like described [here](https://github.com/tis-gmbh/vscode-migrate#usage). You can play around with this project however you like. If you want to return the `src` directory to its original state, run `npm run reset`, but be aware that this will only reset the files, not any commits performed by the extension.
